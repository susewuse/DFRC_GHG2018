18-Jan,1/1/18,2018,1,1,374,650,dairy,"Dairy farms are predominantly carbon sources, due to high livestock emissions from enteric fermentation and manure. Integrated crop-livestock systems (ICLS) have the potential to offset these greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, as recycling products within the farm boundaries is prioritized. Here, we quantify seasonal and annual greenhouse gas budgets of an ICLS dairy farm in Wisconsin USA using satellite remote sensing to estimate vegetation carbon sequestration and IPCC guidelines to calculate farm emissions. As a whole, the farm was a large carbon sink, owing to natural vegetation carbon sinks and harvest products staying within the farm boundaries. Dairy cows accounted for 80% of all emissions as their feed intake dominated farm feed supply. Manure emissions (15%) were low because manure spreading was frequent throughout the year. In combination with soil conservation practices, ICLS farming provides a sustainable means of producing nutritionally valuable food while contributing to sequestration of atmospheric CO2.",6.5,0,0,0.44,0.2,10,10,90,0
